<h1>SDict Viewer</h1>
<p>SDict Viewer is a viewer for dictionaries in open format
developed by <a href="http://axmasoft.com">AXMA Soft</a>. Primary goal
of the project is to provide usable dictionary application for <a
	href="http://www.nokia.com/770">Nokia 770</a> running <a
	href="http://www.maemo.org">Maemo</a>. Because SDict Viewer is written
in Python and its user interface is implemented in PyGTK, it should be
possible to run it on any platform where Python and PyGTK are available.
Many free dictionaries, reference books and encyclopedias are available
for download at <a href="http://sdict.com">http://sdict.com</a></p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Nokia 770</h2>
<p>SDict Viewer requires Python runtime environment. Please follow
installation instructions at <a href="http://pymaemo.sourceforge.net">Python
for Maemo web site</a>.</p>
<p>Download appropriate .deb package from <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=165272">here</a>
and install it through Application Manager in a usual fashion.</p>
Version 0.1.0 is packaged for Internet Table OS 2005 (Maemo 1.1), all
subsequent versions are for Internet Table OS 2006 (Maemo 2.0).
<h2>Other</h2>
There are no installation packages for other platforms. You can download
the <a
	href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sdictviewer/sdictviewer-0.2.1-src.zip?download">source
code</a>, unpack it and run sdictview.py. Windows users will also need to
download and install Python, GTK and PyGTK (any 2.6 version or greater
should be fine). Most Linux users are likely to have all these installed
already. Please keep in mind the main focus of this project is Nokia
770, so other platforms most likely will not get a lot of attention in
the near future. Windows is especially problematic since it may be quite
tedious to download and install all the libraries mentioned, and they
don't always work as smoothly as they do on other platforms.</div>

<div>
<h1>Fonts</h1>
If you are using dictionaries that have phonetic transcription you may
want to install at least one unicode font that contains International
Phonetic Alphabet characters. Nokia 770 out of the box doesn't have one.
<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/">scripts.sil.org</a> has several good
fonts free to download. Get at least one, <a
	href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=DoulosSILfont">Doulus
SIL</a>, for example. To install a font just create /home/user/.fonts
directory and put the font file there. The system should pick it up, so
when you go to "Options">"Phonetic Font..." in SDict Viewer you should
see it in the list.</div>

<div>
<h1>Limitations and Known Issues</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Opening a dictionary, especially a large one takes a long time
	(on Nokia 770)</li>
	<li>In large dictionaries lookup of certain words may take a
	relatively long time. This is mostly due to the fact that most
	dictionaries use only 3 level short index. When a number of words that
	starts with the same 3 letters is large the further down the list the
	word is the longer its lookup takes.</li>
	<li>References (hyperlinks) in article text are not rendered at
	the same base line as the rest of the text.</li>
	<li>References to other articles may not work in some cases: a
	word in one form may be tagged as reference, but dictionary only
	contains this word in a different form. Current dictionary format
	doesn't provide any additional information to properly resolve the
	reference. How often a user may encounter this depends a lot on a
	specific dictionary and specific language.</li>
	<li>Scrolling large articles is slow.</li>
	<li>No user preferences. The only option right now is which font
	to use for phonetic transcription. Most things should work well enough
	for most users right away, and if they don't - it's better to fix it
	then to wash one's hands and expose it as preference. On the other
	hand, it is nice to have preferences for some things. So what kind of
	preferences the applicaiton will get in the future largely depends on
	user feedback and the time I have (or don't have).</li>
</ul>
